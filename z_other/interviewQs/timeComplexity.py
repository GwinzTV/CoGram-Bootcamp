'''
O(1) Constant time complexity:
 - Remains constant regardless of input size
 - Accessing a list element with its index or performing a basic arithmetic calculation

O(log n) Logarithmic time complexity:
 - Execution time grows logarithmically with input size
 - Very efficient
 - Binary search

O(n) Linear time complexity:
 - Execution time grows linearly with input size
 - iterating over each element in a list
