'''
How does modularisation contribute to the scalability of a software system?

 - By enabling independent deployment of modules. So they can work at scale, i.e. on multiple computers

In a sequence diagram, what does an arrow represent?

 - Control flow

What is the purpose of a use case diagram?

 - It represents the functional requirements of a system from the perspective of its users.

Modularisation:
 - Breaking down software into independent modules enhances maintainability, scalability, and reusability.

Sequence Diagrams:
 - Visualising components interactions elucidates system behaviour over time, aiding in comprehension
    and optimisation.

Use Case Diagrams:
 - Representing system functionalities from the user viewpoints aid in requirement analysis and 
    stakeholder communication.

Modularisation Importance:
 - It streamlines development, promotes code reusability, and enables easier collaboration among teams.

Sequence Diagrams' Utility:
 - They highlight the sequence of events, showcasing message exchanges and system flow.

User Case Diagrams' Significance:
 - They provide a holistic view of system functionalities, ensuring alignment with user needs
    and expectations.

Overall Importance:
 - Together, these tools facilitate the design, development, and understanding of complex softare systems,
    ensuring efficiency and user satisfaction.
